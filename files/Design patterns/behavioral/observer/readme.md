# Observer Pattern

```
Definition : Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.
```

## where to use ?

- Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
- Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.

## Eg

- Social Media Notifications: Users follow others, and get notified when followed users post new content.
- Stock Market Applications: Investors track stock prices and receive real-time notifications when the price changes.
- Email Subscription Services: Subscribers receive notifications via email when a new blog post or newsletter is published.
